## Intro
My name is Will, and I am very excited you are here! This is my first project and first major step into the world of AI, and I am so glad that you decided to check in on my progress.  

I am working on an AI assistant that recognizes and responds to verbal commands given to it by anyone. This is a new personal project I am working on to help me get experience with AI. I chose to pursue this project because it sounded very cool and useful, and I saw potential to learn a lot and add on more features of my own after I completed the initial version. 


## Background
I am following along with this online video tutorial I found randomly on Youtube. The link can be found below. I will take my time with it to understand everything that the tutorial is doing, and I will push my updated code everytime I am done with a session.

## Requirements
Here are all of the packages you need to install in order for this project to work. I recommend you create a new virtual environment to install all of these on. Here are instructions on how to pip install packages and create your own virtual environment: [Pip](#Pip-Install) and [Virtual Environments](#Virtual-Environments)
* speech_recognition
* pyttsx3  


## Future Steps
I plan to add many of my own features and customizations to this project. Here are the ones I thought of so far:
* Custom voice - Train a new AI voice instead of using the pre-made one from the library. Maybe base it off of someone famous.
*
